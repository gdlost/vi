vi for Debian
-------------

This is the traditional UNIX Vi tool, released under 4 clause BSD.

To prevent confusion, tools are added with the suffix ".traditional".
You will need to call "ex.traditional" or "vi.traditional".
Another method would be selecting them explicitly via update-alternatives.
